#Big Bang Model - the creation of space and time
###Hubble's law: the expanding universe
Application of the standard Doppler effect indicated that these galaxies were moving away from us, because of lights from galaxies arrives on Earth red-shift. Which means that the wavelength of the light measured upon arrival is longer than the wavelength at emission. According to the Doppler effect, this implies that the source of the light - the galaxy is moving away from observers on Earth.

###Applications of Hubble's law
- the universe start at a small point, moreover, that at a specific time in the past the entire universe had the size of a point.
- This specific time is taken to be the beginning of the universe (the Big Bang model)
- Not only time, but also the space in which the matter and energy of the universe resider were created at that moment(big bang)
- As space expanded, the distance between clumps of matter increased, leading to the receding galaxies that Hubble observed 

The universe is not expanding into empty space. The expansion of the universe is not like expanding cloud of smoke that fills more and more volume in a room. Space is being stretched in between the galaxies and so the distance between them is increasing, creating the illusion of motion of one galaxy relative to another.

###The age of the Universe

if the universe is assumed to have expanded at a constant rate then; $$\frac{1}{H0}$$ gives the age of the universe. 

A galaxy which is not at a distance **d** from us. It's velocity is thus $$v= H0d$$. In the beginning the galaxy and the Earth were at zero separation from each other. If the present separation of d was thus covered at the constant velocity H0d, the time T taken to archieve this separation must be given by $$H0d=\frac{d}{t}$$ that is, $$T=\frac{1}{H0}$$ where T is a measure of the age of the universe.

$$H0=67.80*10^3(Unit: ms^-1 Mpc^-1$$

###The accelerating universe and red-shift

Space is expanding from the Big Bang and the acceleration of dark energy. But the objects embedded(嵌入) in space, like planets, stars, and galaxies stay exactly the same size.

As space expands, it carries galaxies away from each other. The further galaxies are, the faster they're moving.

The distance-red-shift relation is given by: $$d=\cfrac{cz}{H0}$$
which can be written as:$$d=\cfrac{cz}{H0}(1+\cfrac{1}{2}(1-q0))$$
