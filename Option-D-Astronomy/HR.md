###Mass Luminosity relation 

<font color="red">For stars on the main sequence</font>, there exists a relation between the mass and the luminosity of the star. The **mass-luminosity relation ** states that:

$$L∝M^3.5$$

###Cepheid Variables

Cepheid variable stars are stars whose luminosity is not constant in time but varies periodically from a minimum to a maximum. 

####Cepheid variable used to measure distance?
There was a relation between the period of pulsation in a Cepheid star and its brightness. Brighter stars were shown to have longer periods

**The x-axis above represents the Period**

This can be used to measure the distances to nearby galaxies.

The apparent brightness of a Cepheid star varies periodically with time:

###Stellar evolution: the Chandrasekhar and Oppenheimer-Volkoff limits:

A cloud of gas and dust (nubulae 星云) begins to contract under the forces of gravity. Nebulae and molecular clouds, these sites of pre-birth are dark patches called globules

The star settles into a stable existence on the Main Sequence, generating energy via hydrogen burning. 

The stars on the main sequences keep stable by the equilibrium force from outwards (radiation force) and inwards (gravity force). When "helium flash" (the quantity of the helium increase so much which make it begin to fuse)happened. The huge energy released will blow away the outer layers of the star in an explosion called a **planetary nebula**; Mass is thrown into space, leaving behind the carbon core (and some oxygen).

The time it takes to leave the maibn sequence and reach the **planetary nebula stage** is short, compared with the time spent on the main sequence. 
The path then takes the star to the white dwarf region. The star is now a stable but dead star. **No nuclear reactions take place in the core.


The mass of the core is less than about 1.4 solar masses (2 * 10^30) - the stat will become a stable white dwarf.

If the mass of the core is more than 2-3 solar masses- the **Oppenheimer-Volko limit**. If its mass higher than this , it may collapse further and become a black hole.

If the mass of the core of a star is less than **Chandrasekhar limit** of about 1.4 solar masses it will become a stable white dwarf. 

Initial mass of star (interms of solar masses)     | outcome
:--------------------- | :-------------- 
0.08-0.25          | White dwarf with heluym core
0.25-8 | white dwarf with carbon core
12-40  | Neutron star
>40           | black hole

If the star goes under a planetary nebula, it will become a white dwarf;
If the star goes under a supernova, it will become a black hole, or a neutron star.
