##Sample questions for option D

####White dwarfs and neutron stars
(1) state the property that **determines whether a star ends its life as a white dwarf or as a neutron star.	

- <u>Mass</u>

(2) Define the **Chandrasekhar limit** and use this concept to explain the difference between a white dwarf and neutron star.

- <u>Definition of Chandrasekhar limit: is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star
- If the mass of core < 1.4 times the mass of Sun, it is prevented from further contracting -> white dwarf due to electron degeneracy (坠落). 
- If M > 1.4 times the mass of Sun. core further contracts, causes electrons to combine with protons to produce neutron.
</u>

(3) state the name given to a rotating neutron star

- <u>Pulsar ([脉冲星](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%84%89%E5%86%B2%E6%98%9F))</u>
